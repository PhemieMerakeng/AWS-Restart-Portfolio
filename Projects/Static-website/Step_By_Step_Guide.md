# Hands-On Static Website Project


---

### Project Fundamentals

- Amazon S3: Storage & Hosting Logic Amazon S3 is a high-performance cloud storage service that functions as a serverless web host. By using S3 buckets, the café eliminates the need for manual server maintenance and hardware management. It offers 99.999999999% durability and automatic scaling, providing enterprise-grade reliability and performance at a fraction of the cost of traditional hosting.

- Static Websites: Modern Content Delivery A Static Website consists of "fixed" files—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—delivered to users exactly as stored. Unlike dynamic sites that require complex server-side processing, static sites are lightweight, fast, and highly secure. This makes them the perfect solution for information-driven business pages that need to be delivered reliably to customers.

- The Website Endpoint: Your Digital Address The Website Endpoint is the unique, publicly accessible URL generated by AWS once hosting is activated. It acts as the official "front door" to the bucket, allowing browsers to retrieve and display the café’s content globally. This removes the complexity of traditional server configuration, providing a direct link between stored files and the internet

## AWS Hybrid Cloud Solution for After Hours Café 

###### Project Overview This project showcases a hybrid cloud solution built using AWS services for a small café that hasn’t fully moved to the cloud yet. The aim was to improve reliability, security, scalability, and cost management, while allowing the business to transition to the cloud gradually.

### Accessing AWS and Launching an S3 Bucket

I accessed the AWS Management Console and used the search bar to locate S3, selecting it to enter the storage dashboard. I clicked on Create bucket and created a globally unique name that identified the café project

### Configure Bucket Settings

Once the bucket was created, I navigated to the Permissions tab to adjust access controls. I located the "Block all public access" section, clicked edit, and unchecked the box to allow the bucket to eventually serve content to the internet. Next, I moved to the Properties tab, scrolled to the bottom to find Static website hosting, and selected Enable.

### Upload Website Files

I opened the newly created bucket and clicked on Upload. I dragged and dropped the café’s localized website files—specifically the HTML, CSS, and image assets—directly into the console.

### Update Bucket Policy for Public Access

To ensure the files were actually readable by the public, I returned to the Permissions tab and scrolled to the Bucket policy section. I clicked edit and entered a JSON policy script that granted permission to all users. This step is vital because even if a bucket is public, individual files remain inaccessible until this explicit policy is applied.

### Verify Website Endpoint

With the permissions set, I located the auto-generated Bucket Website Endpoint URL. By clicking this link, I was able to verify that the After Hours Café website loaded correctly in a new browser tab, confirming that the cloud-to-user connection was successful

### Test and Update Content

I conducted a final walkthrough of the live site to verify that navigation and styling rendered correctly across different browsers. This serverless setup provides high operational agility, to update the café's content, I simply re-uploaded the modified files to the bucket, confirming that the changes reflected immediately
